Each image is synthesized by compounding a subject (intruder) with a background using the modified Poisson image editing method. There are 50 different backgrounds and nearly 1000 subjects divided into five classes according to five human poses: creeping, crawling, stooping, climbing and other. The presence of the intruder will be confirmed if the first four poses are detected.","791 Views","https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/pdiws-thermal-imaging-dataset-person-detection-intrusion-warning-systems","https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/styles/home/public/00027_0.JPG?itok=MeW8U6ZF","","","","","","","",""
